# OVN-based Virtual Network Automation

A lightweight project to automate **virtual networking** for small-scale private cloud environments using **Open vSwitch (OVS)** and **OVN**.  
This project focuses on simplicity and efficiency, without relying on heavyweight SDN controllers.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Automated Port Management**  
  - Dynamically add OVS ports during VM creation.  

- **Isolated Subnet Allocation**  
  - Assign VXLAN tunnels for VMs requiring separate subnets.  

- **Gateway Integration**  
  - Use the **Control server‚Äôs OVS L3 switch** as a gateway for internal ‚Üî external connectivity.  

- **Lightweight Automation**  
  - Replace traditional controllers (e.g., OpenDaylight) with **gRPC APIs** + **Python bindings** for OVS.

- **Client**: Sends VM creation/deletion requests.  
- **Control Server**:  
  - Runs OVS/OVN.  
  - Manages ports, VXLAN tunnels, and L3 gateway rules.  
  - Provides gRPC APIs for automation.  
- **Compute Nodes**: Host VMs connected to OVS bridges.

## üîß Core Components

### 1. Control Server
- **OVS/OVN Integration**  
  - Handles port creation (`ovs-vsctl add-port`).  
  - Allocates VXLAN tunnels for network isolation.  
  - Exposes VM lifecycle hooks (create, delete).  
  - Communicates with compute nodes for sync.  

### 2. Network Layer
- **Geneve** for tenant-level segmentation.  


### 3. VM Management
- VM network interfaces dynamically attach to OVS bridges.  
- Each VM can be assigned to:  
  - **Default subnet** (shared)  
  - **Dedicated isolated ip subnet**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Tested in debian based environment.  
- May require modification of filesystem paths and OVS configuration depending on distribution.
